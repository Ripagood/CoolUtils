#CoolUtils

These are some 'cool' utilities UNIX style. For example, use slowOutput to
take stdin and slowly output each character to the stdout.
"./slowOutput 5 < slowOutput.c" will make it look like the programm is being
written to the terminal.

catDelay is a just your normal cat but with a delay after each line sent to
stdout. It works in the same way as slowOutput.
"./catDelay 1 < catDelay.c" will output each line from the catDelay source to
stdout at 1Hz.

The original implementatin of slowOutput was some code from stackoverflow with
the name slowcat.
